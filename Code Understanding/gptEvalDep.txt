Comment 1: 2 - The comment is not accurate. The code does not check for all shards being shut down and there being no other nodes. It actually starts a master node, shuts it down, and checks its status.
Comment 2: 3 - The comment is partially accurate. It does check if the shard status is complete but does not throw any exception. However, it does not provide any context about the node shutdown.
Comment 3: 4 - This comment is mostly accurate. It correctly states that the code is testing the shard status when a node is shut down. However, it could be more specific about the node being a master node.

Comment 1: 2 - The comment is not accurate. The function does not generate a string of a specific length, but a salt string using a specific number of log_rounds.

Comment 2: 3 - The comment is somewhat accurate, but it's not very clear. It does mention that it generates a salt and takes log_rounds as a parameter, but it doesn't explain what log_rounds is used for.

Comment 3: 5 - This comment is accurate, clear, and provides useful information about the function's purpose and how it should be used. It also explains what log_rounds is used for.

Comment 1: 2 The comment is not accurate. The gensalt() function is not used to generate a random URL, but rather a salt for hashing.

Comment 2: 1 The comment is not clear or helpful. It simply repeats the function name without explaining what it does.

Comment 3: 5 This comment accurately describes the function's purpose, which is to generate a salt for use with the BCrypt hash function. It is concise and easy to understand.

Comment 1: 2 - The comment is not accurate. The code does not mark the node as partially aborted, it marks the task as locally aborted.
Comment 2: 1 - The comment is misleading. The code does not remove any node, it isolates the datafeed and marks the task as locally aborted.
Comment 3: 4 - The comment is somewhat accurate. It correctly states that the node is vacated, but it does not mention the isolation of the datafeed or the marking of the task as locally aborted.

Comment 2: 2 - This comment attempts to describe the function and its parameters, but it's not formatted correctly and is difficult to understand as a result.

Comment 3: 1 - This comment is misleading as it mentions memory tracking, which is not mentioned or implied in the code.

Comment 1: 4 - This comment is concise and accurately summarizes the function of the code. However, it could provide a bit more detail, such as mentioning the listener parameter.

Comment 2: 3 - This comment is accurate and mentions the listener parameter, but the syntax and grammar are a bit off, which could potentially confuse the developer.

Comment 3: 2 - This comment is misleading because it adds information ("for all jobs") that is not supported by the code. The code does not specify that it's deleting annotations for all jobs.

Comment 1: 3 - The comment is concise and somewhat accurate, but it doesn't provide enough detail about what the function does, especially regarding the role of the listener.

Comment 2: 2 - This comment is not well-formed. It seems like it's trying to include a parameter description (@param) but it's not formatted correctly and doesn't provide any additional information about what the listener does.

Comment 3: 4 - This comment provides a more detailed description of what the function does, including the role of the listener. However, it could still be improved by explaining what it means to "flush the bulk".

Comment 1: 3 - While it does mention the purpose of the test, it does not provide enough detail about what the code is doing. It doesn't mention the H3 cell or the precision.

Comment 2: 2 - This comment is too vague and doesn't provide enough information about what the code is doing. It doesn't mention the test, the H3 cell, or the precision.

Comment 3: 5 - This comment accurately summarizes the function of the code, mentioning the test, the H3 cell, and the precision. It is expressed naturally and concisely, and it would help a developer understand the code quickly.

Comment 3: 2 - This comment is somewhat related to the function of the code, but it does not accurately describe the specific action being taken. The code is merging new values, not compressing current data in a buffer.

Comment 2: 2 - This comment is not very helpful. It repeats the function name without explaining the conditions under which the scaling occurs. It also uses the '@param' and '@return' tags incorrectly, as these are meant for JavaDoc comments, not inline comments.

Comment 3: 5 - This comment is clear, concise, and accurately describes what the function does, including the role of the 'isSampled' check and the 'probability' variable.

Comment 1: 4 - The comment is concise and accurately describes the function of the code. However, it does not mention the return value or the specific conditions under which the validation occurs.

Comment 2: 3 - This comment is detailed and includes information about the parameter and return value. However, it is misleading because it states that -1 is returned if the header value is valid, while the code returns -1 if the length of the value is 0.

Comment 3: 2 - This comment is concise but lacks detail. It does not provide any information about the conditions under which the validation occurs or the return value.

Comment 1: 3 - This comment is accurate and concise, but it doesn't provide any information about the format of the argument or what the method does with it.

Comment 2: 2 - This comment seems to be incomplete and a bit confusing. It starts to provide information about the parameter, but doesn't finish the thought. It also doesn't explain what the method does with the argument names.

Comment 3: 4 - This comment is the most informative of the three. It explains what the method does (sets the argument names) and provides some information about the format of the input (a string). However, it could be improved by explaining what the method does with the string (splits it into an array of argument names).

Comment 1: 3 - The comment is somewhat accurate but it doesn't fully explain what the method does. It doesn't mention that the method throws an exception if the UserTransaction is null or that it looks up the UserTransaction if cacheUserTransaction is false.

Comment 2: 4 - This comment is more accurate and concise. It explains that the method returns a UserTransaction, but it doesn't mention the conditions under which this happens.

Comment 3: 2 - This comment is misleading. The code does not support programmatic lookup if the UserTransaction is null, it throws an exception in this case. The comment also doesn't mention the condition under which the lookup occurs.

Comment 1: 1 - This comment is not only incorrect (the function does not throw IOException and does not check if level is less than 0), but it also does not accurately describe what the function does.

Comment 2: 3 - This comment is somewhat accurate but it is not very clear. It does not explain what "this indentation" refers to and does not mention the refresh of the indent writer.

Comment 3: 5 - This comment accurately and concisely describes what the function does: it increases the indentation level and refreshes the indent writer.

Comment 1: 3 - This comment is somewhat accurate but it does not mention the translation part of the function, only rotation and scale.

Comment 2: 2 - This comment is confusing and does not accurately represent the function. It mentions 'trn rotation' which is not clear, and does not mention scaling. The part about returning a reference for chaining is useful, but overall the comment is not very helpful.

Comment 3: 5 - This comment accurately and concisely describes the function of the code. It mentions all three operations (translation, rotation, and scaling) that the function performs.

Comment 1: 2 - The comment is not clear and does not accurately describe the function of the code. It only mentions one line segment and does not mention the intersection point.

Comment 2: 2 - The comment is concise but not accurate. The code is not checking for intersection of points, but line segments. It also doesn't mention the intersection point.

Comment 3: 5 - This comment accurately and concisely describes the function of the code. It mentions that the code checks for intersection of two line segments and returns the intersection point if they do intersect.

Comment 1: 1 - This comment is not accurate. The code does not convert radians to degrees. It calculates the angle between two points in degrees.

Comment 2: 2 - This comment is partially accurate. The code does calculate an angle, but it does not specify that it's between two points on a plane, and it doesn't mention that the result is in degrees.

Comment 3: 5 - This comment is accurate, detailed, and comprehensive. It correctly describes the function of the code, including the direction of the angle, the range of the result, and the units of the result.

Comment 2: 2 - This comment is not very helpful. It does not explain what the function does, and the @param and @return tags are not used correctly.

Comment 1: 4 - This comment is concise and accurately summarizes the function of the code, but it could provide a bit more detail, such as mentioning the use of a quaternion for the rotation.

Comment 2: 2 - This comment seems to be a mix of a method description and a parameter description. It's not very clear and it's not properly formatted. The '@param' tag is used in JavaDoc to document a method's parameters, but here it's used in a confusing way.

Comment 3: 3 - This comment is more detailed than the first one and it accurately describes the function of the code. However, it's not entirely clear because it mentions a 'particle controller', which is not mentioned in the code. It might be confusing for a developer who is not familiar with the context.

Comment 1: 3.5 - The comment is accurate and concise, but it doesn't provide much detail about the function of the code.

Comment 2: 2 - The comment is not expressed naturally and it's a bit redundant. The '@return' annotation is typically used in JavaDoc comments, not in-line comments.

Comment 3: 4.5 - This comment is accurate, concise, and provides a bit more detail about the function of the code. It could be improved by explaining what an HttpMessageConverter is or why they are being configured.

Comment 1: 3 - The comment is somewhat accurate but it doesn't mention the jitter or the fact that the backoff time is calculated based on past attempts.

Comment 2: 4 - This comment is more accurate than the first one as it mentions that the backoff is based on the number of past attempts. However, it still doesn't mention the jitter.

Comment 3: 5 - This comment accurately summarizes the function of the code, mentioning both the exponential backoff and the jitter. It's expressed concisely and would help a developer understand the code quickly.

Comment 1: 3 - While it does summarize the function of the code, it is not entirely accurate. The code doesn't return a word as a lowercase integer, it converts an integer representation of a word to lowercase.

Comment 2: 1 - This comment is incorrect. The code converts a word to lowercase, not uppercase. Also, the comment is not formatted correctly for a JavaDoc comment.

Comment 3: 5 - This comment accurately describes the function of the code and provides additional context about the algorithm used (SWAR), which could be helpful for understanding the code.

Comment 1: 2 - The comment is misleading. The code does not check if the queue is full or too large, but rather if it's below a certain threshold.
