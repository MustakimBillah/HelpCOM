"Comment 1: 2/5 - The comment is vague and does not accurately describe the function of the code. It only mentions that the method can be overridden by subclasses, but it does not explain what the method does.

Comment 2: 2/5 - This comment is very brief and does not provide enough information about the function of the code. It only mentions that the method rewrites a query, but it does not explain how or why.

Comment 3: 5/5 - This comment accurately and concisely summarizes the function of the code. It explains that the method rewrites a given query using a provided context and ensures that the rewritten query is serializable, which helps developers understand the code quickly."

Comment 3: 5/5 - This comment is accurate, clear, and provides useful information about the function's purpose and how it should be used. It also explains what log_rounds is used for."
"Comment 1: 2/5. The comment is not accurate. The gensalt() function is not used to generate a random URL, but rather a salt for hashing.

"Comment 1: 4 - This comment is concise and accurate, but it could provide a little more detail about what the retention leases are or why they might be needed.

Comment 2: 3 - This comment is also accurate and concise, but the syntax is a bit awkward. The '@return' tag is typically used in Javadoc comments, not in-line comments.

"Comment 1: 1/5 - This comment is not accurate and seems to be cut off. It does not provide a clear summary of the function of the code.

Comment 2: 4/5 - This comment is accurate and provides a good summary of the function of the code. However, it could be more concise.

Comment 3: 5/5 - This comment is accurate, concise, and provides a clear summary of the function of the code. It would help a developer understand the code quickly."

"Comment 1: 1/5 - This comment is not clear and does not accurately represent the function of the code. It seems to be a part of the code rather than a comment.

Comment 2: 2/5 - This comment is concise but lacks clarity. It does not fully explain what the function does and is missing the proper syntax for a Javadoc comment.

Comment 3: 5/5 - This comment is clear, concise, and accurately describes the function of the code. It would help a developer understand what the function does quickly."

"Comment 1: 4 - This comment is concise and gives a basic understanding of what the method does, but it could provide a bit more detail.

Comment 2: 2 - This comment is not very clear and lacks proper formatting. It does not provide a clear explanation of what the method does.

Comment 3: 5 - This comment is clear, concise, and accurately describes what the method does. It provides a good understanding of the method's function."

"Comment 1: 1/5 - The comment does not accurately describe the function of the code. It seems to be a piece of code rather than a comment.

Comment 2: 4/5 - The comment is concise and gives a general idea of what the function does, but it could be more specific about what is being returned (i.e., the URI builder).

Comment 3: 5/5 - This comment accurately and concisely describes the function of the code, making it easy for a developer to understand what the function does."

"Comment 1: 1/5 - This comment is incorrect and does not accurately describe the function of the code. It seems to be a piece of code rather than a comment.

Comment 2: 4/5 - This comment is accurate and concise, but it could be more descriptive about what the ""position count"" is.

Comment 3: 5/5 - This comment is accurate, concise, and provides a good description of what the ""position count"" is, making it easier for developers to understand the code."

"Comment 1: 3.5 - The comment is accurate and concise, but it doesn't provide much detail about the function of the code.

Comment 2: 2 - The comment is not expressed naturally and it's a bit redundant. The '@return' annotation is typically used in JavaDoc comments, not in-line comments.

Comment 3: 4.5 - This comment is accurate, concise, and provides a bit more detail about the function of the code. It could be improved by explaining what an HttpMessageConverter is or why they are being configured."
"Comment 1: 3/5 - The comment is somewhat accurate but it doesn't mention the jitter or the fact that the backoff time is calculated based on past attempts.

Comment 2: 4/5 - This comment is more accurate than the first one as it mentions that the backoff is based on the number of past attempts. However, it still doesn't mention the jitter.

Comment 3: 5/5 - This comment accurately summarizes the function of the code, mentioning both the exponential backoff and the jitter. It's expressed concisely and would help a developer understand the code quickly."
"Comment 1: 3/5 - While it does summarize the function of the code, it is not entirely accurate. The code doesn't return a word as a lowercase integer, it converts an integer representation of a word to lowercase.

Comment 2: 1/5 - This comment is incorrect. The code converts a word to lowercase, not uppercase. Also, the comment is not formatted correctly for a JavaDoc comment.

Comment 3: 5/5 - This comment accurately describes the function of the code and provides additional context about the algorithm used (SWAR), which could be helpful for understanding the code."

Comment 3: 5/5 - This comment accurately and concisely describes what the code does. It uses clear, natural language that would help a developer understand the code quickly."
