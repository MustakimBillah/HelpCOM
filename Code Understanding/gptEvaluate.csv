"Comment 1: 2/5 - The comment is too vague and does not provide enough information about the function's operation.
Comment 2: 1/5 - The comment is incorrect, as the function converts to lowercase, not uppercase. The @param and @return tags are also not used correctly.
Comment 3: 4/5 - The comment is accurate and provides a good level of detail about the function's operation, but it could be more concise.
Comment 4: 1/5 - The comment is not relevant to the function's operation.
Comment 5: 3/5 - The comment is accurate but could provide more detail about how the bitmask transformation is applied.
Comment 6: 4/5 - The comment is accurate and provides a good level of detail about the function's operation, but it could be more concise.
Comment 7: 4/5 - The comment is accurate and provides a good level of detail about the function's operation, but it could be more concise.
Comment 8: 3/5 - The comment is partially correct, but it assumes that the input is an ASCII character, which may not always be the case.
Comment 9: 4/5 - The comment is accurate and provides a good level of detail about the function's operation, but it could be more concise.
Comment 10: 1/5 - The comment is too vague and does not provide enough information about the function's operation.
Comment 11: 3/5 - The comment is partially correct, but it assumes that the input is an ASCII-encoded integer, which may not always be the case.
Comment 12: 4/5 - The comment is accurate and provides a good level of detail about the function's operation, but it could be more concise.
Comment 13: 3/5 - The comment is accurate but could provide more detail about how the upper-case pattern is applied and how it affects the output."
